The goal of this project is the development of a wrist-worn pulse oximeter. Detection of vital signs from the wrist is a challenging task, as the signal is weak and the sensor is prone to motion artifacts, but this positioning is ideal for comfortable continuous monitoring.

A companion app for iOS and macOS allows to visualize real-time data and to configure the device over Bluetooth LE.
