		<h2 class="text-5xl font-semibold">Goals</h2>
		<p>
			The goal of this project is the development of a wrist-worn pulse oximeter. Detection of vital
			signs from the wrist is a challenging task, as the signal is weak and the sensor is prone to
			motion artifacts, but this positioning is ideal for comfortable continuous monitoring.
		</p>
		<p>
			Being a wearable device, it's important to have wireless access to recorded data. This is why
			we developed a companion app for iOS and macOS devices, along with two open source BLE
			modeling libraries.
